The School of Bitcoin is creating Decentralized Autonomous Education System (DAES) centered around financial literacy. The path to creating TSOBTC's DAES will be marked by the project based learning subDAOs that the community creates (curriculumDAOs). You can think of TSOBTC DAES as a organism/universe and each curriculumDAO as an organ/galaxy.

TSOBTC DAES program is focused on creating a base curriculum creating the underlying cryptoeconomic system that connects the DAOs and subDAOs within the DAES ecosystem. 

### Challenge
[What's the challenge TSOBTC is addressing?]

### Focus
[What is the institutional/geographic focus?]

### Proposed Solution
[What's the proposed solution? (the cryptoeconomic flow chart from TSOBTC's Whitepaper 2.0)]

TSOBTC is committed to a transparent process for creating this DAES Conceptual Design (CD). Each GitHub issue will cover all of the information needed to populate the CD metadata for TSOBTC's DAES. You can follow the same process for your own DAES's conceptual design.
